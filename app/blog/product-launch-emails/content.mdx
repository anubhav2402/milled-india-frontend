# How Indian D2C Brands Announce New Products via Email

A product launch without a strong email strategy is a product launch half-done. Email remains the most reliable channel for driving immediate awareness and first-day sales for new products, especially in the Indian D2C ecosystem where social media algorithms are unpredictable and paid acquisition costs keep climbing. After analyzing **7,000+ emails from 150+ Indian D2C brands** on MailMuse, we have mapped out how the best brands use email to turn new arrivals into bestsellers.

## The Anatomy of a Product Launch Email Strategy

Our data shows that product launch approaches fall into two distinct camps: the single-email announcement and the multi-email launch sequence. The choice between them typically correlates with the significance of the launch and the brand's email marketing maturity.

**Single-email launches** are the norm for routine new additions — a new colorway, a seasonal variant, or a minor line extension. These represent about 60% of [New Arrival emails](/types/new-arrival-emails) in our database.

**Multi-email launch sequences** are reserved for hero products, new category entries, or major collaborations. Top brands like [boAt](/brand/boAt), [Sugar Cosmetics](/brand/Sugar%20Cosmetics), and [Lenskart](/brand/Lenskart) consistently deploy 3-4 email sequences for their marquee launches.

## The 4-Email Launch Sequence

The most effective product launch sequences we observe follow a structured four-email framework over 7-10 days.

### Email 1: The Teaser (T-5 to T-3 Days)

The teaser email builds anticipation without revealing the full product. It typically includes a cryptic visual, a launch date, and an invitation to "be the first to know." Some brands include a waitlist or early-access signup link.

[mCaffeine](/brand/mCaffeine) has executed this approach effectively, sending minimalist teaser emails with a single ingredient hint and a date — letting their audience speculate and build organic buzz on social channels.

**Subject line patterns:** "Something new is brewing," "Mark your calendar," or "Coming soon — you are going to love this." These tend to be shorter than average at 28-35 characters.

### Email 2: The Reveal (T-1 Day or Launch Day)

The reveal email is the centerpiece of the sequence. It features full product photography, key benefits, pricing, and a prominent "Shop Now" CTA. This is where brands invest their heaviest design effort.

Our analysis shows that the most effective reveal emails follow a clear visual hierarchy:

1. Hero product image (above the fold, high resolution)
2. Product name and one-line positioning statement
3. Three to four key benefits or differentiators
4. Price point with any launch-exclusive offer
5. Single, prominent CTA button

Brands in [Beauty & Personal Care](/industry/beauty-and-personal-care) tend to include ingredient callouts and usage instructions, while [Fashion & Apparel](/industry/fashion-and-apparel) brands focus on styling and lookbook imagery.

### Email 3: The Social Proof Push (T+2 to T+3 Days)

Within a few days of launch, top brands send a follow-up featuring early customer reactions, influencer endorsements, or "selling fast" signals. This email addresses the natural hesitation of subscribers who saw the launch email but did not purchase.

[Mamaearth](/brand/Mamaearth) frequently uses this approach, sharing early review snippets and star ratings within days of a new product launch. The social proof email converts the "interested but not convinced" segment.

### Email 4: The Extended Reach (T+5 to T+7 Days)

The final email in the sequence targets subscribers who did not open or engage with the previous emails. It reframes the product from a different angle — perhaps focusing on a specific use case, a comparison to a previous bestseller, or a time-limited introductory offer.

This email often has the most direct promotional tone in the sequence, sometimes including a launch-week discount that creates urgency for fence-sitters.

## Subject Line Strategies for Product Launches

Product launch subject lines in our database differ meaningfully from [Sale emails](/types/sale-emails) and other promotional types. Here are the key patterns:

**Curiosity-driven openers perform well.** Subject lines that hint without revealing ("You have never seen anything like this") drive higher open rates for teaser emails than descriptive alternatives.

**Product name in subject line.** For the reveal email, including the actual product name in the subject line helps with brand recall and search. Roughly 55% of reveal emails in our database name the product directly.

**"New" is the most common keyword.** Across all new arrival emails, the word "new" appears in approximately 70% of subject lines. While this is expected, it also means differentiation must come from what follows that keyword.

**Launch-specific urgency.** Phrases like "Just Dropped," "Now Live," and "First Look" create immediacy without resorting to discount language. These perform well because they appeal to the desire for novelty rather than savings.

## Industry-Specific Launch Patterns

Different industries approach product launches with distinct strategies:

**[Beauty & Personal Care](/industry/beauty-and-personal-care):** Ingredient-led storytelling dominates. Launch emails often dedicate significant space to explaining the key ingredient, its benefits, and how the product fits into an existing routine. Before-and-after imagery and dermatologist endorsements are common trust signals.

**[Fashion & Apparel](/industry/fashion-and-apparel):** Visual-heavy with minimal text. The product imagery does the selling, often showing the item styled in multiple ways. Size-range callouts and "available in X colors" messaging are standard. [Bewakoof](/brand/Bewakoof) and similar brands frequently lead with collection themes rather than individual products.

**[Food & Beverage](/industry/food-and-beverage):** Flavor and occasion positioning drive launch emails. Brands connect new products to specific moments — "your new morning ritual" or "the perfect evening snack." Nutritional highlights and ingredient transparency feature prominently.

**[Electronics & Gadgets](/industry/electronics-and-gadgets):** Specification-driven with comparison tables. [boAt](/brand/boAt) and similar brands structure launch emails around feature lists, technical specs, and price-to-value positioning versus competitors or their own previous models.

## Launch-Day Offers: To Discount or Not?

A key strategic question our data illuminates: should you offer a discount on launch day?

The brands in our database are split. Approximately 40% of product launch emails include some form of introductory offer, while 60% launch at full price. The decision tends to align with brand positioning:

- **Premium brands** rarely discount on launch, preferring early-access exclusivity as the incentive
- **Value-oriented brands** frequently include launch-day discounts of 10-20% or bundle deals
- **Mid-market brands** often offer a gift-with-purchase or free shipping rather than a direct price cut

The important nuance is that brands which discount every launch risk conditioning their audience to never buy at full price — the same dynamic seen with [Sale emails](/types/sale-emails) that run too frequently.

## Common Product Launch Email Mistakes

Our analysis flags these recurring errors:

- **No teaser phase.** Jumping straight to the launch announcement without building anticipation wastes the opportunity to prime your audience.
- **Too many products at once.** Launching multiple products in a single email dilutes the impact of each. The best launches focus on one hero product per sequence.
- **Weak photography.** Product launch emails live or die on visual quality. Low-resolution or generic product shots undermine even the strongest copy.
- **No follow-up sequence.** Sending a single launch email and moving on ignores the subscribers who need multiple touchpoints before purchasing.
- **Missing the story.** Features and specs matter, but the brands that connect new products to a customer need or aspiration consistently see higher launch-day conversion.

## Actionable Takeaways

Build your next product launch email strategy with these principles:

1. **Deploy a multi-email sequence** for significant launches — teaser, reveal, social proof, and extended reach
2. **Invest in hero product photography** as the single highest-impact element of your launch email
3. **Lead with curiosity in teaser subject lines** and specificity in reveal subject lines
4. **Include social proof within 3 days** of launch to convert hesitant subscribers
5. **Align your launch offer strategy** with your brand positioning — not every launch needs a discount
6. **Tailor your content approach** to your industry's purchase decision drivers
