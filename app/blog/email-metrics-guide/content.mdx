# The Email Metrics That Actually Matter for D2C Brands

Email marketing dashboards are overflowing with numbers. Open rates, click rates, bounce rates, list growth, unsubscribes, heat maps, device splits, time-of-day breakdowns — the data is abundant. The challenge for D2C brands is not accessing metrics but knowing which ones deserve attention and which are distractions dressed up as insights.

After analyzing sending patterns and campaign structures across **7,000+ emails from 150+ Indian D2C brands** on MailMuse, we have identified which metrics the most disciplined operators focus on and which ones they wisely deprioritize.

## The Metrics Hierarchy: What to Track and Why

### Tier 1: Revenue Metrics (The Only Ones That Pay the Bills)

**Revenue per email sent (RPE)**
This is the single most important email metric for any D2C brand. It answers the fundamental question: how much money does each email you send generate? RPE accounts for both reach and effectiveness — a high open rate means nothing if nobody buys.

To calculate RPE, divide total email-attributed revenue by total emails sent in a given period. The most sophisticated brands in our database segment this by email type — [Sale emails](/types/sale-emails) naturally carry higher RPE than newsletter content, but tracking both reveals whether your non-promotional emails are contributing to revenue or just consuming sends.

**Revenue per subscriber**
While RPE measures campaign efficiency, revenue per subscriber measures the value of your list. Divide total email-attributed revenue by total active subscribers. If this number is stagnant while your list grows, you are adding low-quality subscribers — a common problem for brands that rely on aggressive popup discounts for list building.

**Conversion rate (email to purchase)**
The percentage of email clicks that result in a completed purchase. This metric sits at the intersection of email quality and landing page effectiveness. A high click rate with a low conversion rate signals that the email is doing its job but the post-click experience is failing — a problem that many brands misdiagnose as an email issue.

### Tier 2: Engagement Metrics (Leading Indicators)

**Click-through rate (CTR)**
CTR measures the percentage of delivered emails that generated at least one click. This is the most reliable engagement metric available because, unlike open rates, it requires genuine user action. Across our database, the brands with the highest sending consistency — brands like [Nykaa](/brand/Nykaa), [boAt](/brand/boAt), and [Mamaearth](/brand/Mamaearth) — tend to maintain healthy CTRs by keeping their email content tightly aligned with subscriber expectations.

For Indian D2C brands, typical CTR benchmarks vary significantly by category. [Beauty & Personal Care](/industry/beauty-and-personal-care) brands tend to see higher CTRs on product recommendation emails, while [Electronics](/industry/electronics-and-gadgets) brands see peak engagement on sale and discount emails.

**Click-to-open rate (CTOR)**
CTOR measures what percentage of people who opened your email actually clicked. This isolates the effectiveness of your email content from the effectiveness of your subject line. A high open rate but low CTOR means your subject line is compelling but your email body is not delivering on the promise. This is a critical diagnostic metric that many D2C brands overlook.

**Open rate (with caveats)**
Open rates remain the most widely discussed email metric, but they deserve significant caveats since Apple's Mail Privacy Protection was introduced. MPP pre-loads tracking pixels, inflating open rates for Apple Mail users. For the Indian D2C market, where Android and Gmail dominate, open rates are somewhat more reliable than in Western markets — but they should still be treated as directional rather than precise.

Use open rates to compare performance across your own campaigns over time, not as an absolute benchmark. A 25% open rate from your list is not directly comparable to a competitor's 25% because list composition, acquisition methods, and hygiene practices all differ.

### Tier 3: List Health Metrics (Maintenance Metrics)

**Unsubscribe rate**
A steady unsubscribe rate under 0.5% per send is generally healthy. Spikes above this after specific campaigns indicate content or frequency problems. Some brands panic at any unsubscribes, but a small, consistent rate is actually a sign of a healthy list self-cleaning. It is when unsubscribes suddenly double or triple that you should investigate.

**Bounce rate**
Hard bounces (permanently undeliverable addresses) should be removed immediately. Soft bounces (temporary delivery failures) become a concern only if the same addresses repeatedly soft bounce. Brands that maintain clean lists through regular hygiene see better inbox placement and more reliable metrics across the board.

**Spam complaint rate**
This is the metric that can actually damage your ability to send email at all. If your spam complaint rate exceeds 0.1%, inbox providers will start throttling or filtering your emails. Monitor this relentlessly. If it spikes, reduce frequency and review your most recent campaigns for content that might feel unsolicited or irrelevant.

## Metrics That Deserve Less Attention Than They Get

**List size as a standalone number**
A list of 500,000 subscribers sounds impressive until you learn that only 50,000 are active. List size without engagement context is a vanity metric. Focus on active subscriber count — people who have opened or clicked within the past 90 days.

**Social shares from email**
While some email platforms prominently display social sharing buttons and track their usage, the actual share rates are negligibly small for most D2C campaigns. This metric rarely warrants dashboard space.

**Time-of-day open data**
Interesting but often misleading. Open time data tells you when people check email, not when they are most likely to buy. Many brands obsess over send-time optimization when the far more impactful lever is email content quality.

## Building a Metrics Dashboard That Works

Based on patterns from the most consistent senders in our database, an effective D2C email metrics dashboard should include:

- **Weekly view**: RPE, CTR, CTOR, and unsubscribe rate for each campaign sent
- **Monthly view**: Revenue per subscriber, list growth rate (net of unsubscribes), and spam complaint rate
- **Quarterly view**: Revenue attribution trends, segment performance comparisons, and lifecycle email performance by stage

The key is reviewing these metrics at the right cadence. Checking RPE daily leads to overreaction. Reviewing list health only annually means problems go unnoticed for months.

## Actionable Takeaways

Based on our analysis across MailMuse:

1. **Prioritize revenue per email sent** as your north-star email metric — it captures both reach and effectiveness in a single number.
2. **Use click-to-open rate** to diagnose content quality separately from subject line performance.
3. **Treat open rates as directional** and avoid making major strategy changes based on small open rate fluctuations.
4. **Monitor spam complaint rate** above all list health metrics — it directly impacts deliverability.
5. **Benchmark against yourself**, not industry averages. Track how your competitors approach email strategy by exploring real campaigns on [MailMuse](/browse).
