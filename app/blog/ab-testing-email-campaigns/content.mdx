# A/B Testing Your Emails: What Indian D2C Brands Should Test First

Most Indian D2C brands know they should be A/B testing their emails. Far fewer actually do it systematically. The common excuse — "we do not have enough volume" — is usually wrong. Even brands with modest list sizes can run meaningful tests if they focus on the right variables and measure the right outcomes. Drawing on patterns from **7,000+ emails across 150+ Indian D2C brands** tracked in the MailMuse database, here is a practical framework for what to test, in what order, and how to interpret results.

## Why Most A/B Tests Fail Before They Start

Before diving into what to test, it is worth understanding why email A/B testing goes wrong:

- **Testing too many variables at once** — Changing both the subject line and the CTA button means you cannot attribute any difference to either change
- **Ending tests too early** — Declaring a winner after two hours ignores subscribers who check email in the evening or the next morning
- **Ignoring statistical significance** — A 2% difference with 500 opens is noise, not signal
- **Testing trivial elements** — Spending weeks testing button color (red vs. blue) while ignoring the offer itself

The brands we see running the most consistent email programs in the MailMuse database tend to test one high-impact variable at a time and let the test run long enough to produce reliable data.

## The Testing Priority Stack

If you are starting from zero, here is the order in which to test email elements — ranked by potential impact on your bottom line:

### 1. Subject Lines (Test This First)

Subject lines determine whether your email gets opened or ignored. They are the single highest-leverage element you can test. Across the MailMuse database, we observe significant variation in subject line approaches even within the same brand, suggesting active testing.

Variables worth testing:

- **Length**: Short (under 30 characters) vs. medium (30-50 characters) vs. long (50+ characters)
- **Emoji vs. no emoji**: Our data shows that about **32% of D2C emails** include emojis in subject lines, but effectiveness varies significantly by category
- **Specificity**: "New Arrivals" vs. "12 New Summer Dresses Just Dropped"
- **Urgency framing**: "Sale Ends Tonight" vs. "Last 6 Hours: Extra 20% Off"
- **Question vs. statement**: "Looking for the Perfect Gift?" vs. "The Perfect Gift Guide Is Here"

Brands in [Beauty & Personal Care](/industry/beauty-and-personal-care) tend to test ingredient-led subject lines against benefit-led ones — "Vitamin C Serum" vs. "Get Glowing Skin in 7 Days." [Women's Fashion](/industry/womens-fashion) brands frequently test trend-based hooks against discount-based ones.

### 2. Send Time and Day

When you send can matter as much as what you send. Our data reveals that Indian D2C brands cluster their sends around certain windows, but the optimal time varies significantly by audience.

Test these time windows:

- **Morning (8-10 AM)** vs. **Evening (6-8 PM)** — These are the two most common send windows we observe
- **Weekday vs. weekend** — [sale emails](/types/sale-emails) often perform differently on weekends when subscribers have more browsing time
- **Payday-adjacent sends** — Some brands test sends on the 1st and 15th of the month against mid-week sends

Run send-time tests for at least two full weeks to account for weekly variation. A single week's data can be misleading.

### 3. Call-to-Action (CTA) Design and Copy

Your CTA is where engagement converts into action. Test these variables:

- **Button text**: "Shop Now" vs. "Explore the Collection" vs. "Get Yours"
- **Button placement**: Above the fold vs. after product details
- **Number of CTAs**: Single focused CTA vs. multiple options
- **Button size and color**: High-contrast vs. brand-subtle

Our analysis shows that the most active brands tend to use direct, action-oriented CTA copy. "Shop Now" remains the most common CTA across Indian D2C emails, but brands like [Nykaa](/brand/Nykaa) frequently test more specific alternatives tied to the campaign context.

### 4. Email Layout and Content Structure

Once you have optimized subject lines, timing, and CTAs, test your overall email structure:

- **Product grid layout**: 2-column vs. single-column product displays
- **Content length**: Short and punchy vs. detailed with storytelling
- **Hero image vs. text-first**: Leading with a visual vs. leading with a headline
- **Number of products featured**: 1-2 hero products vs. 6-8 catalog-style

Brands in [Electronics & Gadgets](/industry/electronics-and-gadgets) often find that single-product focused emails outperform catalog-style layouts because their products require more explanation. [Food & Beverage](/industry/food-and-beverage) brands, where purchase decisions are quicker, often see the opposite.

### 5. Offer Structure

This is the most impactful but also the most resource-intensive test:

- **Percentage off vs. flat amount off**: "20% Off" vs. "Rs. 500 Off"
- **Free shipping vs. discount**: Which motivates more purchases at your average order value?
- **Bundle offers vs. single-product discounts**: "Buy 2 Get 1 Free" vs. "30% Off Everything"
- **Threshold-based offers**: "Free shipping over Rs. 999" vs. no threshold

## How to Measure Results Correctly

Different tests require different success metrics:

| Test Element | Primary Metric | Secondary Metric |
|---|---|---|
| Subject line | Open rate | Click-to-open rate |
| Send time | Open rate | Revenue per email |
| CTA | Click-through rate | Conversion rate |
| Layout | Click-through rate | Time on site |
| Offer structure | Conversion rate | Revenue per email |

The critical mistake is measuring subject line tests by conversion rate or offer tests by open rate. Match the metric to the variable you are testing.

## Sample Size and Duration Guidelines

For reliable results, follow these minimums:

- **Subject line tests**: At least 1,000 recipients per variant, run for 24-48 hours
- **Send time tests**: At least 2,000 recipients per variant, run across two full weeks
- **CTA and layout tests**: At least 1,500 recipients per variant, run for 48-72 hours
- **Offer tests**: At least 2,000 recipients per variant, measure through a full conversion window (7 days minimum)

If your list is smaller, focus your tests on subject lines where even 500 recipients per variant can yield directional insights.

## Building a Testing Culture

The brands with the strongest email programs do not treat A/B testing as an occasional exercise — they make it a default. Every campaign is an opportunity to learn something. Over time, these incremental insights compound into a deep understanding of what your specific audience responds to.

Start a testing log. Record every test you run, the hypothesis behind it, the results, and what you learned. After six months of consistent testing, you will have a playbook that is worth more than any generic best practices guide.

## Actionable Takeaways

1. **Start with subject lines** — they offer the highest leverage with the lowest effort
2. **Test one variable at a time** and let tests run long enough for statistical significance
3. **Match your metric to your variable** — do not measure subject line tests by conversion rate
4. **Use MailMuse to generate hypotheses** — [browse competitors' emails](/brands) to see what approaches they are testing and identify patterns worth trying
5. **Build a testing log** and treat every send as a learning opportunity

Systematic testing beats gut instinct every time. The brands that commit to a testing discipline are the ones that steadily pull ahead in the inbox.
